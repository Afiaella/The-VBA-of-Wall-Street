# The VBA of Wall Street


 In this project, I used VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data.


## Analysis

I created a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:


1. The ticker symbol.


2. Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year, 
conditional formatting was used to highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.


3. The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.


4. The total stock volume of the stock.

This is what the initial dataset looked like:

This is what the data looked like by the end of the analysis:
