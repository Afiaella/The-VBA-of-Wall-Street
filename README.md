# The VBA of Wall Street


 In this project, I used VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data.


## Analysis

I created a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:


1. The ticker symbol.


2. Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.


3. The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.


4. The total stock volume of the stock.

This is a comparison between the initial dataset and the final dataset:

Additionally I used conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

This is what the data looked like by the end of the analysis:
